        "### Embeddings\n",
        "When building recommendation systems, categorical features typically have massive cardinalities, posts, users, ads, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to represent these entities and model these relationships, **embeddings** are used. In machine learning, **embeddings are a vectors of real numbers in a high-dimensional space used to represent meaning in complex data like words, images, or users**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Embeddings in RecSys\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you might wonder, how are these embeddings generated in the first place? Well, embeddings are represented as individual rows in an **Embedding Table**, also referred to as embedding weights. The reason for this is that embeddings/embedding table weights are trained just like all of the other weights of the model via gradient descent!\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedding tables are simply a large matrix for storing embeddings, with two dimensions (B, N), where\n",
        "* B is the number of embeddings stored by the table\n",
        "* N is the number of dimensions per embedding (N-dimensional embedding).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The inputs to embedding tables represent embedding lookups to retrieve the embedding for a specific index/row. In recommendation systems, such as those used in Meta, unique IDs are not only used for specific users, but also across entites like posts and ads to serve as lookup indices to respective embedding tables!\n",
        "\n",
        "Embeddings are trained in RecSys through the following process:\n",
        "1. **Input/lookup indices are fed into the model, as unique IDs**. IDs are hashed to the total size of the embedding table to prevent issues when the ID > # of rows\n",
        "2. Embeddings are then retrieved and **pooled, such as taking the sum or mean of the embeddings**. This is required as there can be a variable # of embeddings per example while the model expects consistent shapes.\n",
        "3. The **embeddings are used in conjunction with the rest of the model to produce a prediction**, such as [Click-Through Rate (CTR)](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2615875?hl=en) for an Ad.\n",
        "4. The loss is calculated with the prediction and the label for an example, and **all weights of the model are updated through gradient descent and backpropogation, including the embedding weights** that were associated with the example.\n",
        "\n",
        "These embeddings are crucial for representing categorical features, such as users, posts, and ads, in order to capture relationships and make good recommendations. Meta AI's [Deep learning recommendation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00091) (DLRM) paper talks more about the technical details of using embedding tables in RecSys.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will introduce the concept of embeddings, showcase TorchRec specific modules/datatypes, and depict how distributed training works with TorchRec."

These tables represent entities and relationships, such as users, pages, posts, etc. Given that these entities are always increasing, a **hash** function is typically applied to make sure the ids are within the bounds of a certain embedding table. However, in order to represent a vast amount of entities and reduce hash collisions, these tables can become quite massive (think about # of ads for example). In fact, these tables can become so massive that they won't be able to fit on 1 GPU, even with 80G of memory!\n",

However, GPUs come with the limitation of scarce fast memory (HBM which is analgous to RAM for CPU), typically ~10s of GBs.\n",

On the other hand, **data parallel** is where the entire model is replicated on each GPU, which each GPU taking in a distinct batch of data for training, syncing gradients on the backwards pass.\n",

The recommended way to apply the optimizer in TorchRec is through PyTorch's `apply_optimizer_in_backward` API. This gives you parameter level granualtiy and as such lets you define different optimizers or optimizer parameters for each paramter in your model.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this level of control, you can define a different optimizer for a set of parameters or for embedding_bags as a whole. A key thing to note here, you need to be aware of is the parameter naming. EmbeddingBagCollections will be named something similar to `embedding_bags....` and EmbeddingCollections `embeddings...`. Inspect the model parameters through `model.named_parameters()` to understand how your model parameters are named.\n",
        "\n",
        "TorchRec uses `CombinedOptimizer` which contains `KeyedOptimizers` within. A `CombinedOptimizer` effectively makes it easy to handle multiple optimizers for various sub groups in the model. A `KeyedOptimizer` extends the `torch.optim.Optimizer` and is initialized through a dictionary of parameters exposes the parameters. Each `TBE` module in a `EmbeddingBagCollection` will have it's own KeyedOptimizer which all combined into one `CombinedOptimizer`.\n",

This is an optimization in TorchRec and FBGEMM, the optimizer embedding gradients are not materialized and direclty applied to the parameters. This brings significant memory savings are embedding gradients are typically size of the parameters themselves. You can, however, choose to make the optimizer \"dense\" which does not apply this optimization and let's you inspect the embedding gradients or apply computations to it as you wish. A dense optimizer in this case would be your [canonical PyTorch model training loop with optimizer.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the optimizer is created through DistributedModelParallel, you still need to manage an optimizer for the dense parameters. This you will do through the canonical PyTorch training loop, to find the dense parameters, you can call `in_backward_optimizer_filter(model.named_parameters())`. Apply the dense optimizer to those parameters as you would a normal Torch optimizer and combine this and the `model.fused_optimizer` into one `CombinedOptimizer` that you can use in your training loop to `zero_grad` and `step` through.\n",
