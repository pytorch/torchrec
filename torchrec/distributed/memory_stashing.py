    A single bulk ``copy_`` (an H2D restore or a D2H stash) saturates the CUDA
    copy engine until it finishes, serializing every same-direction copy from
    other streams behind it (see the ``copy_engine_execution_order`` study).
    Splitting the transfer into chunks of at most ``chunk_size_bytes`` bytes —
    with a tiny dummy compute op enqueued between chunks — breaks the back-to-back
    readiness of consecutive same-stream copies, so the copy engine yields
    between chunks and lets other streams slip their (typically small) copies
    into the gaps. This reduces, but does not eliminate, the contention latency.

    The copy runs on the current CUDA stream; wrap the call in
    ``with torch.cuda.stream(...)`` to target a specific stream.

    Args:
        dst: Destination tensor, written in place.

        non_blocking: Passed through to each per-chunk ``copy_`` for async DMA.
        dummy_compute: If True, enqueue a tiny ``add_`` between chunks so the
            copy engine yields to other streams. The study shows chunking alone
            does not yield — under current-stream-first scheduling consecutive
            same-stream copies run back-to-back as one uninterrupted block.

        Stash a list of CUDA tensors from HBM to CPU asynchronously.

        Core implementation shared by ``stash_embedding_weights`` and
        ``stash_optimizer_state``.  Wraps the D2H copy and HBM free into an
        ``execute_stash`` callable.  In non-delayed mode the callable is
        invoked immediately; in delayed mode it is returned for the caller
        to invoke later.

        Args:
            tensors: CUDA tensors to stash.  Non-CUDA / empty tensors are
                silently skipped.
            label: Human-readable label used in ``record_function`` profiling
                annotations (e.g. ``"embedding"`` or ``"optimizer state"``).
            sync_event: Optional CUDA event recorded on the caller's stream.
                When provided, the D2H stream waits on this event instead of
                calling ``torch.cuda.current_stream()``.  This is required
                when ``_stash_tensors`` runs on a background thread, where
                ``current_stream()`` would return the wrong (idle) stream.
            delay: If True, do NOT execute the stash immediately.  The
                returned ``execute_stash`` callable must be invoked later
                to perform the actual D2H copy and free HBM.  A sync event
                is recorded automatically so that the deferred execution
                waits for the correct GPU work.
            stash_chunk_size_bytes: Trunk size for the D2H copy, passed to
                ``chunked_copy_``.  ``None`` falls back to
                ``_DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE_BYTES``; the public ``stash_*`` entry
                points always pass their use case's configured value.
            restore_chunk_size_bytes: Trunk size for the H2D copy in the
                returned ``restore`` callback.  Same fallback as above.

        Returns:
            A tuple of three callback functions:
            - await_restore: Pauses current stream awaiting restore completion
            - restore: Retrieves stashed data from CPU back to HBM asynchronously
            - execute_stash: Performs the D2H copy and frees HBM.  Accepts an
              optional ``torch.Tensor`` so it can be registered as a backward
              hook.  In non-delayed mode it has already been called and is
              safe to call again (no-op on empty tensor list).

        Stash embedding weights from HBM to CPU asynchronously.

        Starts an async copy of embedding weights from GPU (HBM) to CPU
        (pinned memory) using the shared D2H stream. HBM is freed immediately
        using ``record_stream`` to let the caching allocator handle stream
        ordering — no background thread or CPU-blocking synchronize needed.

        Args:
            lookup: A lookup module (e.g., GroupedPooledEmbeddingsLookup) containing
                embedding modules with weights to stash.

        Returns:
            A tuple of three callback functions, or None if no tensors qualify
            for stashing (e.g., all tables have ``stash_weights=False``):
            - await_restore: Pauses current stream awaiting restore completion
            - restore: Retrieves stashed data from CPU back to HBM asynchronously
            - execute_stash: Performs the actual D2H copy and frees HBM.  Takes
              an optional ``torch.Tensor`` argument so it can be registered as
              a backward hook.  In immediate mode this is a no-op (stash
              already happened).  In delayed mode (``set_delay_stash(True)``),
              this callable is auto-appended to the pending list and should be
              triggered later via ``execute_pending_stashes()``.

        Usage:
            >>> await_restore, restore, execute_stash = MemoryStashingManager.stash_embedding_weights(lookup)
            >>> # In immediate mode: stash already happened, execute_stash is no-op
            >>> # In delayed mode: call execute_pending_stashes() later to trigger

        Note:
            - Uses pinned CPU memory for efficient async transfers
            - Uses d2h_stream for stash (GPU->CPU) and h2d_stream for restore (CPU->GPU)
            - record_stream tells the caching allocator not to reuse memory until
              the D2H copy completes, avoiding GIL deadlocks from background threads
            - restore starts async copy, await_restore blocks GPU stream until complete

           (fused backward+optimizer) can update the correct cache slots.

        Batch_i+1 prefetch is handled separately by the pipeline via

        This method works with any optimizer that stores state tensors in
        ``optimizer.state``, including Shampoo (with nested
        ShampooKroneckerFactors), Adam, SGD with momentum, etc.

        Args:
            optimizer: A PyTorch optimizer containing state tensors to stash.
            sync_event: Optional CUDA event recorded on the caller's stream that
                the D2H/H2D streams wait on (required when run on a background
                thread). Forwarded to every slice's stash.
            num_slices: Number of byte-balanced slices to partition the collected
                state into for gradual restore. ``1`` (default) preserves the
                single-shot behavior. When ``> 1`` each slice is stashed
                independently and its restore is registered as a separate
                callback (slice 0 first), to be driven per-hook via
                ``restore_optimizer_state_next``; the returned ``await_restore``
                then gates on ALL slices' restore completion.

        Returns:
            A tuple of two callback functions:
            - await_restore: Pauses current stream awaiting restore completion
              (of all slices when ``num_slices > 1``)
            - restore: Retrieves stashed data from CPU back to HBM asynchronously
              (all slices when ``num_slices > 1``)

        Usage:
            >>> await_restore, restore = MemoryStashingManager.stash_optimizer_state(optimizer)
            >>> # ... HBM is freed via record_stream (allocator reclaims after D2H completes) ...
            >>> # Before optimizer.step():
            >>> restore()  # Start async restore from CPU to HBM
            >>> await_restore()  # Wait for restore to complete before using state
            >>> optimizer.step()  # Now optimizer state is available

        Note:
            - Uses pinned CPU memory for efficient async transfers
            - Uses d2h_stream for stash (GPU->CPU) and h2d_stream for restore (CPU->GPU)
            - record_stream tells the caching allocator not to reuse memory until
              the D2H copy completes, avoiding GIL deadlocks from background threads
            - restore starts async copy, await_restore blocks GPU stream until complete
            - Only CUDA tensors are stashed; CPU tensors and non-tensor state are left unchanged
            - Supports nested structures like Shampoo's ShampooKroneckerFactors
