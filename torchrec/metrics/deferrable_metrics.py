"""Unified metrics type for sync and async metric access.

Thread safety: This class relies on CPython's GIL for safe mutation of
_data and _resolved from Future callback threads. The GIL ensures that
attribute assignment is atomic, so concurrent reads of is_resolved() or
resolve() will see a consistent state. If used outside CPython (e.g.,
free-threaded Python 3.13t), a threading.Lock would be needed.

    Two changes from the default `.to("cpu", non_blocking=True)` pattern:

    1. Issues the copies on a dedicated per-device CUDA stream rather than
       the caller's current stream. The caller's current stream is normally
       the default training stream, where ZORM's large DtoH would queue
       behind training kernels and block any subsequent operation submitted
       there (training kernels, NCCL collectives, main-thread pageable DtoH).
       The dedicated stream is independent, so ZORM transfers run in parallel.
    2. Allocates pinned CPU destinations so cudaMemcpyAsync is truly async
       on the host (no staging buffer wait on the caller side).

    `wait_stream(producer_stream)` preserves the data-dependency on the
    producer's last write to the source tensors before the transfer starts.

    Returns the CPU tensor dict and a CUDA event recorded on the dedicated
    stream that tracks completion. For CPU-only inputs, returns the dict
    as-is with None event. Only CUDA tensors are transferred; CPU tensors and
    non-tensor values are passed through unchanged. CUDA tensors are assumed to

    Metrics container that wraps either a resolved dict or a pending Future.

    - resolve(): sync access, blocks if backed by Future
    - update(other): deferred merge
    - is_resolved(): check without blocking

    Implements Mapping[str, Any] so it is a drop-in replacement for
    Dict[str, MetricValue] at both type and runtime level. Dict-style
    access (__getitem__, __iter__, __len__) calls resolve() internally.

    Future-backed instances emit a `DeferrableMetrics.deferred_failure`
    INFO event to `torchrec_event_logging` if the Future raises. Success
    is already captured by the enclosing `RecMetricModule.compute` decorator,
    so no SUCCESS counterpart is emitted here. The done-callback fires once
